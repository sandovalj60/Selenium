Selenium
Selenium is a library for automating web browsers in Python. It provides a range of tools for interacting with web pages and applications, as well as for testing and scraping web content. Selenium is particularly useful for tasks such as automated testing, web scraping, and data extraction.

    from selenium import webdriver

    # create a webdriver object
    driver = webdriver.Firefox()

    # navigate to a website
    driver.get("https://www.example.com")

    # find elements on the page
    element = driver.find_element_by_css_selector("p.text")

    # interact with elements
    element.click()
    element.send_keys("Hello World")

    # take a screenshot
    driver.save_screenshot("screenshot.png")

    # close the browser
    driver.close()
